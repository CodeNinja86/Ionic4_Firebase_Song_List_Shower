# Ionic4 Firebase Song List Shower

## What's new?

*This template does not work on its own*. The project applied some change for angularfirebase2/database adaption.
To use this template, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy the files from this repository into the [Starter App Base](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base).

### With the Ionic CLI:

Take the name after `ionic2-starter-`, and that is the name of the template to be used when using the `ionic start` command below:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova typescript
$ npm start ionic:serve
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac.
